        <item>The present main hall of the Peshawar Museum was built in 1906\–07 in the memory of Queen Victoria at the cost of Rs.60000, out of which Rs.45000 were donated by the public of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Rs.15000 by the Director General of Archaeology, India. After completion of the building, the museum was set up in November 1907 to house the Gandharan Sculptures excavated from the major Gandharan sites of Shah\–Ji\-Ki\-Dheri Peshawar, Sahri Bahlol, Takht\-i\-Bahi in the Mardan District and later from Jamal Garhi and other Gandharan sites excavated by British scholars. The two storey building, an amalgamation of the British and Mughal architectures, originally consisted of a main hall and two side aisles on the ground and first floor, surmounted by four elegant cupolas and small pinnacles on all the corners. On the eastern and western side of the building, two halls were added in similar fashion in 1969\-70 (one on each side). In 1974\-75, the second storey was added to these side halls.</item>
        <item>Pushkalavati (modern Charsadda), and the first capital of Gandhara from 6th to 1st century BC, is situated 30 km to the northeast of Peshawar. The term Pushkalavati is a combination of two Prakrit words \'Pushkara/Pushkala\' and \'wati/vati\', which mean \'lotus\' and \'city\' respectively. The area is still very fertile and had ponds full of lotus flowers around the city, remnants of which can be seen around the site of Balahisar. The city goddess was also called Pushkalwati. The lotus flower, which also symbolized Buddha in archaic sect, is still grown in Charsadda. The legendary Hariti Devi and Panchika were born here and converted to Buddhism by Lord Buddha. The Syama Jatakat also took place. The he stupa of the \"Eye Gift\" was built here, to commemorate the generous gift of eyes by Buddha to the people of the land, which was recorded by Chinese pilgrims, who had visited the site. This region is also known as \"Hashtnagar\" which is a Persian word meaning \'eight villages\'. According to Prof. Dani this name is the informal form of \"Astes Nagar\", (city or village of Astes) called after its ruler Astes who ruled Gandhara before the onslaught of Alexander the Great in 327 BC.</item>

Present \“Sethi house\” was taken by the heritage department and is now a museum, still under renovation. The house was constructed primarily with bricks, wood, sand and jute with beautiful carvings, glass and woodwork</item>

        <item>Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) is a high quality high capacity transport system, which provides fast,
            efficient, reliable and comfortable mode of transport for the travelers. In a BRT system, the buses travel in
            a dedicated corridor and avoid the congestion on the road.

            \n\n According to details, the BRT track stretches over 26 kilometers and has 31 stations with Chamkani and
            Hayatabad serving as the terminals. There will be 450 buses in the BRT fleet, each having a capacity
            of up to 95 people.\n\n
            Last month, the KP government had revealed that fares for BRT will start at Rs.10 which will go up to Rs. 50
            depending on the distance traveled.
